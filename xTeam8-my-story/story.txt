Across the room, a well worn dragon sits in the corner at GOH, several martial artists, and Jin Mori, a carefree martial artist is asleep
on the couch. Both Snore. The bell sounds as the next match set to begin. Finally, he awakens. He looks down and calls upon the heavly realm to 
summon the power of Sun Wukong. 
But his opponent doesn't wake up. In fact, he hasn't stirred, and the bell's still ringing. Jin pokes him; nothing, no movement. He's not breathing.
